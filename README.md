# RemoteJobScraper

The Remote Job Scraper is a Python script that extracts job listings from remote.co, specifically targeting developer jobs. It scrapes job titles, companies, and links to job descriptions, and saves the data to an Excel file for further analysis. I am still brainstorming ways to expand on the project and add more functionalities.

**Features**
- Scrapes job titles, companies, and links from remote.co.
- Handles pagination to scrape multiple pages of job listings.
- Saves scraped data to an Excel file for easy viewing and analysis.
